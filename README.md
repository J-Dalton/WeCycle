As part of my Computing BSc, this website was developed for my Final Year Project. I received a grade of 76% for this project.

Just to note, if you do wish to view and use the website, I've added the database structure with some tables populated. 
The database connection file will have to match your own. If the details match, an admin account can be added directly to the database 
within phpMyAdmin. There are 2 account types, admin and normal. The passwords are hashed but for testing purposes are all set to be "123".
